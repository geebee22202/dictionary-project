## Dictionary App

This dictionary app was built  as part of my training in the SheCodes bootcamp. When a word is searched on the app, it will return the definition for each part of speech in which the word is used. It will also render the pronounciation, and audio of the word being pronounced, and images associated with the word. This app was inspired by Google's dictionary search function.
